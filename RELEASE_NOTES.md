# Stream Engine

# Release 1.4.1 2018-02-13

Issue #13195 - Fix empty datasets with custom dims not being handled correctly

# Release 1.4.00 2018-02-02

Issue #12001 - Do not open provenance/annotation files in append mode

Issue #13025 - Add support for custom dimensioned data
- add support for custom dimensional data sets
- add support for __builtin__ PythonFunction in preload database,

  functions should expect inputs in 2d arrays of [obs,data]
  and output data as 2d array of [obs,data]

  functions should be valid Python syntax and use only standard
  Python built-in functions

  for example, see the enumerate function in preload database
  ParameterFunctions.csv:

  functiontype: PythonFunction
  name: enumerate
  owner: __builtin__
  function: [[idx for idx, _ in enumerate(x[0])]]
  args: ['x']
