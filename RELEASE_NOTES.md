Issue #12879 - Prevent data without deployment info from returning
- add require_deployment query parameter and default configuration setting

By default, data without deployments will not be returned via data requests.

To override the default behavior on a per request basis, set the query parameter
require_deployment=false when making a data request.

Issue #13025 - Add support for custom dimensioned data
- add support for custom dimensional data sets
- add support for __builtin__ PythonFunction in preload database,

  functions should expect inputs in 2d arrays of [obs,data]
  and output data as 2d array of [obs,data]

  functions should be valid Python syntax and use only standard
  Python built-in functions

  for example, see the enumerate function in preload database
  ParameterFunctions.csv:

  functiontype: PythonFunction
  name: enumerate
  owner: __builtin__
  function: [[idx for idx, _ in enumerate(x[0])]]
  args: ['x']
